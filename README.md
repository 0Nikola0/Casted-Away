# Casta Way

## Setting: Spain, 1918 

You and your family have come back from the New World and your children
are of mixed race. As you are trying to find your place in the rigid 
Casta (caste) system of Spain that discriminates by race, a deadly virus
enters the scene. Can you make the right choices and survive?

## Content

As we are dealing with historical racial issues, no insensitivity to
present-day peoples is intended. We hope this game may inspire some
to do further reasearch into similar issues of mixed-race discrimination
in history.
