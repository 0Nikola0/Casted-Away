# Casta Way

## Setting: Spain, 1918 

You and your family have come back from the New World and your children
are of mixed race. As you are trying to find your place in the rigid 
Casta (caste) system of Spain that discriminates by race, a deadly virus
enters the scene. Can you make the right choices and survive?

## Controls and Gameplay

Each _turn_ is a month in real time. You must make a plan for the coming
month. Select your choice from the menu and observe the consequences.
Keep in mind all the things your family will need to survive and the
_risks_ of going out.

You have limited time to decide and each choice affects the next. After
you meet your doom, reflect on your mistakes and try again. Explore ways
to keep yourself and your family alive during these deadly seasons. If only
you could undo every mistake you made, if only life was just as forgiving...

## Content & warnings

This game explores historical racial issues, along with the topic of the
1918 Spanish flu. We want to raise awareness of the issues of the past and
present, and do not intend any harm to anyone. We hope this game may inspire
some to do further reasearch into similar issues of mixed-race discrimination
in history, and stand up for justice.
